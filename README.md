# weather-app-vanilla
Project for Amigo Technology

Hello, 

This is created at the request of Amigo Technology as a Technical Test.

Simple Weather Application made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML , CSS, webpack, NPM, OpenWeatherAPI and babel.
The application requests Geolocation services with the browser and only after permission starts working. The only functionality
is chaning the weather from celsius to fahrenheit. 

*I wanted to insert a input searchbar (+geolocation) as well for more functionality but I think the API doesn't allow it and 
I reckon it would've taken me more than three hours. 
*Also, I made a GIF and attached it because it happened to me sometimes that the API request was blocked because too many requests were made on the same address. (I know, bad quality, <25MB)

:)
