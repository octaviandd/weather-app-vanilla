# weather-app-vanilla
Project for Amigo Technology

Hello, 

This is created at the request of Amigo Technology as a Technical Test.

Simple Weather Application made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML , CSS, webpack, NPM, OpenWeatherAPI and babel.
The application requests Geolocation services with the browser and only after permission start working. The only functionality
is chaning the weather from celsius to fahrenheit. 

*I wanted to insert a input searchbar as well for more functionality but I think the API doesn't allow more than one call and 
I reckon it would've taken me more than three hours. 


:)
